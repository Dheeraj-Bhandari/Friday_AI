My name is Dheeraj. I have created this Friday AI speech recognizer program on pyhton 3.0.

# This program recognize speech of user and act accordingly. Like you can simply say "Friday open Youtube, Google, Wikipedia, facebook,
and it will open it for you in browser 

#You can also ask it to play music (You need to add music directory first in order to make it able to play music for you)

# You can also search any topic from wikipedia in it " Just simply say Friday i want ___ information from wikipeida" 
and it will tell you about that topic, person or anything which is available on wikipedia.

# you can ask for time date etc.

# you can also excuate your custom program in this (Just mention path ) I used my code editor path in it.
